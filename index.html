                    The Service Management System project utilizes various technologies, including Java, SpringBoot, Gradle, JPA, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Tomcat Server, and Angular.JS. It provides a comprehensive solution for customers to sign up, register their electrical appliances, and create service requests for repairs. Customers can also track the progress of their service requests.
                    <br><br>The system includes an admin section where administrators can view all the service request tickets raised by customers. Admins have the ability to update the status of the tickets and assign technicians to handle them.
                    <br><br>Furthermore, there is a dedicated technician login page where technicians can access a list of service requests assigned to them. Technicians can update the status of these requests, ensuring efficient communication and tracking within the system.
